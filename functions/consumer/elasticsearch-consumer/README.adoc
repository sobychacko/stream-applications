# Elasticsearch Consumer

A consumer that allows you to index document records into Elasticsearch.

## Beans for injection

You can import `ElasticsearchConsumerConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`Consumer<Message<?>> elasticsearchConsumer`

After injecting this `Consumer` bean in the application, it's `accept` method can be called programmatically to index Elasticsearch documents.
This consumer only supports indexing documents with JSON formats.
The JSON document can be provided using one of the following methods.

* Plain JSON string
* `java.util.Map`
* `XContentBuilder` provided by Elasticsearch

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `elasticsearch.consumer`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/consumer/elasticsearch/ElasticsearchConsumerConfiguration.java[ElasticsearchConsumerProperties].

In addition to these options, the consumer makes use of Spring Boot autoconfiguration for Elasticsearch.
Therefore you need to use https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/elasticsearch/ElasticsearchRestClientProperties.java[these properties] for configuration Elasticsearch.
See this https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-elasticsearch[section] from Spring Boot docs.

## Tests

See this link:src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/consumer/elasticsearch/ElasticsearchConsumerApplicationTests.java[test suite] for seeing the Elasticsearch consumer in action.

## Other usage

See this https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/applications/sink/mqtt-sink/README.adoc[README] where this consumer is used to create a Spring Cloud Stream application where it makes a MQTT sink.
