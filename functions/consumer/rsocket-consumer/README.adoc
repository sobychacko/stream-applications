# RSocket Consumer

A consumer that allows you to communicate to an RSocket route using its fire and forget strategy of execution.
The consumer uses the RSocket support from https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#rsocket-requester[Spring Framework].

## Beans for injection

You can import `RSocketConsumerConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`Function<Flux<Message<?>>, Mono<Void>> rsocketConsumer`

You can use `rsocketConsumer` as a qualifier when injecting.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `rsocket.consumer`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/consumer/rsocket/RsocketConsumerProperties.java[RsocketConsumerProperties].
