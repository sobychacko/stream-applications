# Syslog Supplier

Syslog supplier that produces both TCP and UDP based syslog events.
The `Supplier` uses the `TcpSyslogReceivingChannelAdapter` and `UdpSyslogReceivingChannelAdapter` from Spring Integration.
This supplier gives you a reactive stream of messages and the supplier has a signature of `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.
Users have to subscribe to this `Flux` and receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `SyslogSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`syslogSupplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.

You can use `syslogSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `syslog.supplier`.
